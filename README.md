# elastic

## A command-line tool to query the Elasticsearch REST API

`elastic.go` was born to turn commands that look like this:

```
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes/_all/host,ip' | python -m json.tool
```

into this:

```
elastic node list
```

`elastic` fetches data from your Elasticsearch instance, formats the data
nicely when it is JSON compressed data, and adds a bit of colors to make it more
readable to the human eye. It aims at providing shortcuts for all default
Elasticsearch routes. For instance, you can get the cluster health with
`elastic cluster health` (or `elastic c he` for short).

Of course, you can still issue any `GET` requests with
`elastic query <YOUR REQUEST HERE>` (or `elastic q` for short), like
`elastic q twitter/tweet,user/_search?q=user:kimchy'`.
By design, only `GET` requests are allowed. I wanted to make it easy to query
Elasticseach indexes, not deleting them so use the good old `curl -XDELETE ...`
if this is what you want to achieve.
There is currently no support for `PUT` requests either since I have no use for
it. Pull requests are welcome however.

## Installation
